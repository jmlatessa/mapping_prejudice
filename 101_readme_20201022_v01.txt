*Shapefiles: Shapefiles contain multiple parts to function. Here is a quick extension key to help you identify the different parts and purposes:
.shp—The main file that stores the feature geometry; required. 
.shx—The index file that stores the index of the feature geometry; required. 
.dbf—The dBASE table that stores the attribute information of features; required. 
.prj—The file that stores the coordinate system information; required. 
.sbn and .sbx—The files that store the spatial index of the features and speed up loading times. 
.xml—Metadata for ArcGIS—stores information about the shapefile. 
.cpg—An optional file that can be used to specify the codepage for identifying the character set to be used.
